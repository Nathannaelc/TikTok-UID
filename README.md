# TikTok-UID
Simple bash script to grab TikTok user id from the shared link.

# How?
TikTok appends the UID of the video sharer to the short link (vt.tiktok.com) as a parameter.
This bash script will curl to the link and take the user_id from the URL and echo it out.

# Why?
TikTok probably uses this for analytics purposes.
This script can help you to discover alt accounts.
